# UDI-DICOM Validator Dev

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill for changes to profile, schema, examples, validator, tests, demo,
docs, API, or CLI.

## Required Workflow

Keep schema/examples/validator/tests synchronized. Run `pytest -q`,
`ruff check .`, and the portable ultrasound demo.

## Error Code Policy

Primary error codes must be deterministic and drawn from `docs/error-codes.md`.

## Claims Boundary

Do not claim clinical validation, regulatory approval, certification, safety
assurance, or production deployment. Never expose private assets.


## v0.2 Workflow

Keep `synthetic_workflow_trace_id`, `provenance`, and optional `fdo_mapping` deterministic. Add tests for trace and FDO mapping consistency when behavior changes.

## v0.3 Workflow

Regenerate `tests/golden/` receipts, run `scripts/check_golden_receipts.py`, run
`scripts/build_public_evaluation_matrix.py`, and verify that public MCP tools
only read public examples and public docs.

## v0.4 Workflow

For release hardening, run `scripts/build_public_release_assets.py`,
`scripts/verify_remote_release.py`, and, when network access is available,
`scripts/clean_clone_smoke.py`. Keep release assets public-only. Do not expose
private suite or private service materials. Archive metadata is DOI-ready only
and must not claim an assigned DOI before Zenodo or another archive service
assigns one.

## v0.5 Workflow

For paper review and reproducibility changes, update `paper/`,
`docs/external-review-pack-v0.5.md`, reviewer docs, and the reproducibility
capsule scripts together. Run `scripts/build_reproducibility_capsule.py` and
`scripts/check_reproducibility_capsule.py`. Keep outputs synthetic-only,
public-only, and free of raw DICOM files, PHI, private cases, clinical
validation claims, regulatory approval claims, certification claims, robot
operation evidence, and official FDO implementation claims.

## v0.6 Workflow

For paper submission readiness, keep changes to paper submission documents,
DOI-ready metadata review, feedback intake templates, and Mermaid text figures.
Do not change validator logic, schemas, examples, or receipt semantics. Run
`scripts/build_archive_metadata_report.py`,
`scripts/check_archive_metadata_report.py`,
`scripts/build_paper_submission_package.py`, and
`scripts/check_paper_submission_package.py`.

## v0.8 Workflow

For DOI archive readiness and paper finalization support, keep changes
public-only and documentation/artifact-gate oriented. Run
`scripts/build_doi_archive_review_package.py`,
`scripts/check_doi_archive_review_package.py`, `scripts/check_no_fake_doi.py`,
`scripts/build_paper_finalization_bundle.py`,
`scripts/check_paper_finalization_bundle.py`, and
`scripts/check_citation_metadata_consistency.py`. Do not change validator logic,
schemas, examples, CLI, API, or receipt semantics. Do not write a DOI until a
real Zenodo or archive-service record is verified.
