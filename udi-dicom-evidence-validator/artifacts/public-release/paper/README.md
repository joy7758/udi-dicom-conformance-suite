# Paper Review Pack v0.5

This directory is a public-safe paper drafting and external review pack for the
UDI-DICOM Evidence Validator. It contains a manuscript outline, section drafts,
figures, and tables that describe the public validator, synthetic examples, and
reproducibility capsule.

Scope:

- Minimal UDI-DICOM evidence manifest and deterministic validator.
- Public synthetic examples only.
- Offline registry fixture first; live openFDA remains explicit opt-in.
- FDO-style mapping as metadata alignment only, not an official FDO standard
  implementation.

Out of scope:

- PHI, raw DICOM files, real hospital samples, real customer data.
- Clinical validation, regulatory approval, certification, diagnosis, safety
  assurance, or hospital deployment claims.
- Medical robot operation evidence.

v0.6 adds `paper/submission/` for journal-neutral submission readiness. These
drafts keep references requiring human confirmation in
`paper/references-to-check.md` and do not bind the manuscript to a specific
journal.

v0.8 adds a paper finalization bundle and DOI archive readiness gate. It keeps
title, target journal, final abstract, reference verification, figure rendering,
and DOI insertion as explicit human-review items. DOI insertion is blocked until
a real archive record exists.
